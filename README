Test-Stochastic version 0.00_01
===============================

This module can be used to check the probability distribution of answers given by a method. For example:

 stochastic_ok  {a => 0.4, b => 0.6}, sub { ...random sub...};

The code fragment above checks that the subroutine passed to C<stochastic_ok> returns C<a> with probability 0.4, and C<b> with probability 0.6.

This module will work only if the return values are numbers or strings. Future versions will handle references as well.
